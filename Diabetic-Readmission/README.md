# Diabetic-Analysis:

This modules involves analysis of more than 1,00,000 Clinical Database Patient Records aiming to understand the factors that are respondible for early readmission of a patient given his/her clinical information. 

The module makes extensive use of Py-Spark Data Frame framework and Spark Machine Learning Library (MLlib).

The whole analytical model can be found inside the file "DiabeticReadmission-Spark.ipynb". Some of the analysis are also written using R and can be found inside "DiabeticReadmission-R.ipynb"
