1. Tuning Parameters:
		k (min_sample) -> Nearest Neighbors
		eps -> The Maximum distance between two points
		metric -> Euclidean, precomputed, Haversine

		single_clusters --> False, True : While performing density Clustering the value "True" would remove all points that are a single cluster (only one point in the cluster) , possible outliers
		how_many = 6

		alpha --> deafualt = 2.5 (The concave hull alpha shape)
